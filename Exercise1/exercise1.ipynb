    "In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",

    "- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

    "Recall that the parameters of your model are the $\\theta_j$ values. These are\n",
